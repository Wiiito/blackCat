              Edgar Allan Poe was an American writer, poet, author, editor, and
              literary critic who is best known for his poetry and short
              stories, particularly his tales of mystery and the macabre. He is
              widely regarded as a central figure of Romanticism and Gothic
              fiction in the United States, and of American literature. Poe was
              one of the country's earliest practitioners of the short story,
              and is considered the inventor of the detective fiction genre, as
              well as a significant contributor to the emerging genre of science
              fiction. He is the first well-known American writer to earn a
              living through writing alone, resulting in a financially difficult
              life and career.

          "The Black Cat" is a short story by American writer Edgar Allan Poe.
          It was first published in the August 19, 1843, edition of The Saturday
          Evening Post. In the story, an unnamed narrator has a strong affection
          for pets until he perversely turns to abusing them. His favorite, a
          pet black cat, bites him one night and the narrator punishes it by
          cutting its eye out and then hanging it from a tree.

                  The second black cat looks almost exactly like Pluto. He's
                  big, black, and missing an eye. The only difference is the
                  white spot. The spot starts off innocently enough, but then
                  grows into an image of the gallows, if the narrator can be
                  believed.
